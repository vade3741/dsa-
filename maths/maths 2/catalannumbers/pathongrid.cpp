// Q.) We are given a n*n grid hence we want to include all the paths such that we always stay either above the main digonal or below the main diagonal
// to always be below the diagonal number of roght moves are always greater than no of top moves
// to always be above the main diagonal number of top moves are always greater than horizontal moves
// this problem is equivalent to a dyck words problem which is equivalent to a catalan number
